## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mediconnect-academy.git
    cd mediconnect-academy
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Google AI API key. This is required for the AI features to work.
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    You may also want to add an NCBI API key to avoid rate limiting on the research assistant.
    ```env
    NCBI_API_KEY=YOUR_NCBI_KEY_HERE
    ```


4.  **Run the development server:**
    The application runs on two concurrent processes: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows.

    - **Start the Next.js app:**
      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```
      This will start the frontend on `http://localhost:9002`.

    - **Start the Genkit AI flows:**
      In a separate terminal, run:
      ```sh
      npm run genkit:watch
      ```
      This will start the Genkit development server, which the Next.js app will call for AI-related tasks.

Once both are running, you can open your browser to `http://localhost:9002` to see the application.
